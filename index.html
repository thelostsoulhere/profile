    <p>As a former resident DJ who worked at renowned clubs from 2011 to 2020. During this time, I also worked as a freelance DJ, bringing my love for music to various venues and events, with a passion for entertaining audiences, I loved the thrill of spinning tracks and creating an unforgettable experience for those in attendance. <br>
        However, the COVID-19 pandemic forced me to pivot my career path. I still love music and occasionally perform DJ gigs for the sheer joy of it.
        Currently, I am pursuing my childhood passion for coding and web development. <br>
        Despite my previous concerns about my perceived lack of math skills, I am discovering that my creativity and problem-solving abilities are assets in this field. <br>
        With my business and employees taken care of, I am able to focus on this exciting new endeavour. <br>
        I am eager to see where this journey takes me and how I can use my passion for both music and technology to create innovative and meaningful experiences for others.
